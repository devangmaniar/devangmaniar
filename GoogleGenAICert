# 1. STATIC BADGES
## 1.1 Importing image
One of the easiest ways is to import images of badges or logos into your GitHub readme. You can also create something similar within your GitHub repository and import it from there. To ensure high quality, you can import images in SVG format. A list of these types of images can be found at the following links: [LINK1](https://github.com/MikeCodesDotNET/ColoredBadges#), [LINK2](https://simpleicons.org/?q=tens) and [LINK3](https://github.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons). Simply copy and paste similar to following code into your GitHub readme to display the image or badge.
